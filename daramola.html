					<p>For our first project, we had to interview someone older than us on their lives.
					My interview subject was my mother, Xiomara Chavez, she was born in El Salvador
					along with her brother and sister. Once we had finished the interview, we
					had to transcribe what they said into an article.</p>

					<p>For our second project, we had to choose an invention from the Industrial 
					Revolution. Once we chose with our groups, we had to make models of the invention
