					We had a big project called the Coding the Past project. This project
					was ment to give us a better understanding of people's pasts. We did this
					through interviews and essays.

					<p>
					In Daramola's class we interviewed someone we knew about their life story.
					For example, I interviewed my mother. Once we had finished recording the interview, we had 
					to transcribe and code the interview in a way that we understood using the codes for historical
					events, positive events, negative events,

					In Noel's class we did two things. One thing we did was use the iterview from 
					Daramola's class and made a collage using important things from interviewie's
					life. Another thing we did was write an essay on one of the biggest events
					from our subject's life, and its historical relevence.
