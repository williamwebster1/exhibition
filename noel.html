					<p>
					Our first project in Noel's class was to make a collage of different images
					based on the things that happened in our subject's life. Our subject was
					the same person from Daramola's interview, and that was where we got 
					most of our information to make the collage.

						<h1> Artist Poem</h1>
					</a>
					<p> Our second project in Noel's class was to use a picture of child
					labor to make a poem and a separate art piece that represented it. Along
					with that we had to make another poem and art piece on social media and 
					a subject of our choosing.
